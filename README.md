### About Me

I'm a curious developer with a passion for exploring the realms of Artificial Intelligence and full-stack development. I enjoy working with AI frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, Hugging Face, and JAX; building robust backends with Django, Flask, and FastAPI; and crafting engaging web apps using the MERN stack and Next.js. I also dive into mobile and desktop development with Electron, React Native, Flutter, and Android Studio, and I'm currently learning Rust along the way.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Electron, React Native, and Rust.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on AI/ML and full-stack projects.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Python, AI frameworks, or web/mobile development.
